## What is OpenSteamInjector?
OpenSteamInjector is a lua and manifest injector for steam:
this allows you to trick steam into thinking that you bought a game legitimately and so it let's you install it for free

## Warning
This program is only meant to use if you legally own a game, we don't have any responsability
if you get in legal trouble for something related to this, you can't blame us as we warned you.
