# Project Discontinued

After reviewing the long‑term direction of this project, I decided to discontinue and archive it.

### Why?

The project interacted with Steam in ways that could:
- conflict with Steam’s Terms of Service  
- cause account or platform issues for users  
- create maintenance and stability concerns  

Even though this was an experimental, educational project, I don’t want to maintain software that could be misunderstood or misused.

### What now?

- The repository is archived for historical reference.
- No further updates or support will be provided.
- Users should avoid using tools that modify or inject into Steam or other protected platforms, as this can lead to account or stability issues.

Thanks to everyone who showed interest in the project.
