# Project Discontinued

After reviewing the long‑term direction of this project, I decided to discontinue and archive it.

### Why?

The project interacted with Steam in ways that could:
- conflict with Steam’s Terms of Service  
- cause account or platform issues for users  
- create maintenance and stability concerns  
- even if its not intended for piracy, i am sure that its gonna be used for it

Even though this was an experimental, educational project, I don’t want to maintain software that could be misunderstood,misused and have a chance to be material of a lawsuit.

### What now?

- The repository is archived for historical reference.
- No further updates or support will be provided.
- Users should avoid using tools that modify or inject into Steam or other protected platforms, as this can lead to account or stability issues.

Thanks to everyone who showed interest in the project.
